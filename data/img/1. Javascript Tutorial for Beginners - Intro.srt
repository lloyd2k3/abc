00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,040
What is javascript.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,730
Javascript is a programming language and not just some regular programming language.

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,380
In fact javascript is the de facto programming language of the web.

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,630
So if you would like to become a web developer you will have to learn javascript.

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,430
Although it is subjective.

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,890
Javascript is considered the most popular programming language in the world.

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:11,670
If the HD model is responsible for the structure of the web page and C Ss is responsible for styling

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,710
of the web page javascript is responsible for the functionality of the web page.

15
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,620
For example an event occurs only when the user presses the button.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:32,380
Lets say some kind of annoying pop up window shows up not only javascript is the king of the web now

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,970
days.

18
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,710
Javascript is everywhere.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,300
It works on the server side.

20
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,560
For example no.

21
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,260
I guess it works on games and tons of other places.

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,570
Another great bonus of javascript is the fact that it is easy to learn.

23
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,980
